## Important Notes

Xellx is not for production and will not be for a while. You will need to setup callback URIs in the Discord Dev Portal (/api/auth/discord/redirect). To authenticate with the dashboard go to the API HOST + `/api/auth/discord`. If you setup the API `.env` correctly it will work. Otherwise submit a bug request.

## Submitting Issues

Please note when submitting issues if the feature looks generally unfinished then it's probably not an issue and just not finished yet.
