# Xellx

### A Discord.JS Bot built with Typescript connecting to a PostgreSQL Database using prisma + a React NextJS 12 Dashboard + an express API.

## Important Notes

Xellx is **NOT** for production and will not be for a while. It is in very early development stages. Expect bugs. You will need to manually setup callback URIs in the Discord Dev Portal (/api/auth/discord/redirect). To authenticate with the dashboard go to the API HOST + `/api/auth/discord`. If you setup the API `.env` correctly it will work. Otherwise submit a bug request.

## Submitting Issues

Please note when submitting issues if the feature looks generally unfinished then it's probably not an issue and just not finished yet.
