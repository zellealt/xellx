# Xellx Dashboard

### A simple guide & easy-to-use template to deploy Next.js with Discord OAuth to Vercel

#### Is the project active?
I had a 2 week break on the project and from bad timing it happened that was when I was implementing the new API so I am working on it a huge commit should be coming soon.

#### Edit
Huge update coming **very** soon, new status page, new server selector page, entire new API, fast response times, loads of bugs fixed, refactored code, new server sidebar, websockets, and more. (the new update may not include all features as I am trying to release as soon as possible)
